#Taking refference from OpenCV Documentation
CV2: OpenCV
OpenCV is an open source computer vision Library used for image processing. 
We have used this here to load the image and further process it to read the text from the image. 
We are converting the image to greysclay to apply the canny method over it.

Canny Method is used for edge detection.
